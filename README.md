## 1. PING-PONG Game on Arduino

<details>

### Source of inspiration

### Description

Imagine this situation: you are with your friends somewhere out and the boredom makes its appearance. Everyone wants to do something different and go to different places. Lucky for you that you have an amazing game of Ping-Pong that will enjoy everyone. All they had to do is to move the paddle with the help of a potentiometer and try to hit the ball.

This project was done in December 2023 as a project for "Linear Electronic Circuits" course from my faculty.

### What I've learned

- how to handle real time given tasks (the move of potentiometer, press the button)
- working with classes
- implementing a circuit and using it
- how the digital/analog signals works

## 2. Weather page

<details>

### Description

You want to go on a vacation somewhere far from your home country, but you're unsure about the current weather conditions. You have a couple of options to get informed: you could open your phone's basic weather app that everyone uses, or you could check out my weather page. There, you can search for your desired destination. You'll receive the best weather information for the current day or for the next 5 days.

This project was done in December 2023 as a project for "Web Technologies" course from my faculty.

### What I've learned

- fundamental JavaScript
- using fetch functionality
- solving UI/UX tasks
- working with APIs

## 3. Solar Tracker

<details>

### Description

We all use electrical energy in our daily lives, but not everyone considers where this energy comes from. It's crucial to rely on renewable sources for our electricity. In this project, I aim to maximize the efficiency of a solar panel by enabling it to track the sun, allowing it to generate electricity more effectively. I've designed this solar tracker to be user-friendly: simply position it with the photoresistors facing east, south, and west, and you can enjoy clean energy for your devices.

This project was done in August 2024 for personal use.

### What I've learned

- working with a stepper motor
- using a voltage divider
- using a receiver module

## 4. Home Services Website

<details>

### Description

You own a nationally recognized company that provides home services, but you believe you can enhance your business by streamlining the scheduling process and improving service record management. One effective solution is to develop a full-stack application with database access to efficiently store and manage data. This not only simplifies internal operations but also creates an opportunity for customers to book appointments more easily and check employee availability.

This project was done in December 2025 as a project for "Web application with Java" and "Databases" courses from my faculty.

### What I've learned

- SQL Syntax
- working with database from backend
- making a full-stack application
- connecting backend to frontend
